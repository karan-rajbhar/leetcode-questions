# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! Here, you'll find solutions to various LeetCode coding challenges. I initially started solving problems using Java, but as I use Python extensively in my job, most of the solutions you'll find here are in Python.

## About the Solutions

I want to clarify that not all the solutions here are entirely my original work. Some of the more challenging problems required me to study and learn existing solutions before I could implement them. I believe in the importance of learning from others in the programming community, and I'm always striving to improve my problem-solving skills.

## Repository Structure

All solutions are in the root directory of this repository, with Java and Python solutions intermixed.

## Using Visual Studio Code for LeetCode

I use the [LeetCode extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LeetCode.vscode-leetcode) to enhance my LeetCode coding experience. This extension allows me to:

- View problem descriptions directly in VS Code.
- Test my code against sample test cases in a local repository.
- Streamline my LeetCode workflow within the editor.



You can find solutions to various LeetCode problems in the root directory.

Feel free to explore the solutions, ask questions, or provide feedback. Happy coding!
